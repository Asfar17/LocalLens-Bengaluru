# Traffic Context: Bangalore Commuting Guide

## Overview

Bangalore's traffic is legendary - and not in a good way. The city's rapid growth has outpaced infrastructure, making commuting a daily challenge. Understanding traffic patterns and transport options is essential for survival.

## Traffic Reality Check

### Peak Hours (Avoid if Possible)
| Time | Direction | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM | Towards IT corridors (ORR, Whitefield, Electronic City) | Extreme |
| 5:30 PM - 9:00 PM | From IT corridors to residential areas | Extreme |
| 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM | Lunch hour movement | Moderate |

### Worst Traffic Zones
- **Silk Board Junction**: Infamous bottleneck, avoid at all costs during peak
- **KR Puram**: Gateway to Whitefield, perpetually jammed
- **Marathahalli**: ORR nightmare zone
- **Hebbal Flyover**: North Bangalore chokepoint
- **Tin Factory**: Connecting multiple areas, always busy
- **Koramangala Signal**: Multiple roads converging

### Relatively Better Times
- Before 7:30 AM
- 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM
- 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM
- After 9:30 PM

## Transport Options
